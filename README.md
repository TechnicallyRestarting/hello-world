# My intro to everyone

## Hello everyone! :wave: I am a tech enthusiast in my early <sup>30s</sup>. I am in a warehouse style job but want to move to a tech related job. I have completed comptia a+ but am looking to increase my tech knowledge. I have a cat named Anya. She thinks she's royalty ~but she's just a drama queen~. Hope to one day been as proficient in computers as the cat here! :laughing:
